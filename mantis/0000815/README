The computation of the size of buffers for XER encoding seems to be wrong.

For T_Boolean, it is 36 (31 should be enough)

Worse, size of a sequence is lower than needed: in the example, size
for T_Boolean_Seq is computed to be 49, when it should be 62.

The provided test shows it.
Change ALLOW_BUG_SHOW_UP in test.c to enable/disable the wrong behaviour.
